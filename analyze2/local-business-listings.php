                    <h2>Map Management - Local, Online and on the Map</h2>
                    <h3>Directory Listings</h3>
                    <p>The more consistent your local business information is along multiple fronts, the better you will perform within the search 
                        engines; you will rank for more organic terms which will lead to more success in the long run.</p>
                    <h3>Consistent Data and Business Description</h3>
                    <p>At Local SEO, we work with you to gather correct information then submit it to over 400 business directories being crawled by the search 
                        engines on a consistent basis.  Forty percent of all published listings online are incomplete or incorrect; we optimize your business to 
                        mobile devices, GPS navigation portals, search directories and major search engines to ensure that your “digital business card” is correct 
                        and customers can find your business.</p>
                    <p>Our teams of dedicated account managers create and manage content relevant to your business. We then distribute your "digital business card" of 
                        information across several local and national online channels that search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo constantly and consistently dig through. 
                        You can't leave your website visibility to chance; it is extremely important that is done correctly and well.</p>

                    <p>Our dedicated team of Account Managers creates and manages the listing content that is relevant to your business including the products and services you provide.  
                        We will work with you to determine what course of action is going to be most beneficial in the long run.  In gathering information such as location, logos, images, 
                        hours of operation and relative categories, we can develop and implement a local directory campaign that will be correct across all fronts; as a result, 
                        we will be able to build up your credibility as a business, your relevancy to searches done by potential clients and the way in which you are displayed to those potential customers.</p>

                    <p>We are continuously updating and training on the best ways to optimize our clients at the local level.  Not only does this ensure that the work we do will be correct the first time, 
                        it will be cohesive to what the search engines are looking for when attempting to provide the best results to customers.  Our goal with your company is to guarantee that your listings 
                        and information will improve in rankings and, as a result, benefit your company for years to come.</p>
                    <h3>Local Maps Posting</h3>
                    <p>We get your business posted on the maps and business listings that often appear towards the top of search engine results.</p>
                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>Local SEO has been doing online local search optimization since 2005. We have worked exclusively with the search engine engineers of Google, Bing and Yahoo and our satisfied clients' listings have generated millions of dollars in revenue due to Local SEO building and managing their local online presence.</p>
