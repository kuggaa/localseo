                        How does incorrect information arrive at the search sites in the first place? Perhaps via a mistyped keystroke or poor character recognition by a scanner or screen reader. Perhaps a franchise has moved and the phone number or physical address has not been updated accordingly. Perhaps franchises have been improperly merged with nearby locations. Or, in a small number of cases, competitors or spammers sometimes maliciously edit other companies' information.

                        Consistency is nearly as important as accuracy in local search results. Mismatched address information (for instance, unrecognized zip codes or conflicting street addresses) can lead to errors in geocoding and can decrease the confidence of search engine algorithms regarding your physical location. Business titles for certain locations may not meet company branding guidelines. In some cases, websites or web pages listed on a particular search engine may not be the company's highest-converting page for that location.
